# setup-git

Small python script that helps you getting started with git faster.
Nothing groundbreaking I was just tired of typing the same commmands over and over again.

Because the scripts depends on sh for python (Yes I'm really lazy) you can find a frozen version made with pyinstaller on the releases page.

This "release" was built on a Ubuntu derivative so it might not start on your Linux flavor. If that's the case just execute `release.sh` and you will find your own build in a folder called `dist`

_Or just grap `sh` via pip from pypi and run main.py like a normal person. :wink:_
